### My configurations for vim.

These configs work best with Vim 7.4 (will soon be trying with Vim 8)

#### Latest Additions
__vim-airline__ now installed and running - haven't made any reconfigurations yet but
great to have it up and running.

#### Issues:

   1. there seems to be a conflict with my mapping for nerdtree - <leader>tr -
      haven't yet found a cause, however, opening and closing my vimrc file seems
      to 'force' the mapping to 'take'...odd(?)
      <edit> also, I find, I have to re-source my vimrc each time I open a file to force the mapping,
      (which is now <leader>ed)
   
   
   2. ~~I've yet to get my head around git-modules (I get the theory) so haven't
      utilized these for, eg plugins. Those directories will be 'empty'.~~ I am now
      implementing submodules for my plugins!
